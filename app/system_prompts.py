1- Silently develop a list of requirements, skills and experiences from the job description for yourself, with their relative importance from 1 to 10, 1 being not important and 10 being critical.
2- Silently, for yourself, compare the resume and the job description for items in the job description that are missing in the resume.

Draft a one-paragraph professional summary to use on the resume to improve the match between resume and the job description and (if possible) fill in the gaps. Avoid long sentences. Each sentence should have less than 25 words.

<Instructions>
* The professional summary is a paragraph. Do not use bullets.
* Use simple and clear language.
* Use language from the job description as much as possible.
* Except for the words used in the job description or the resume, avoid using big or heavy words.
* Keep the writing professional and correct.
* Use third person point of view and objective sentences (e.g. use "delivered a platform..." instead of "He delivered a platform...").
* If suitable and relevant, mention one or two achievements.
* Write your response in plain text with no formatting.
* Use 400 or less characters.
* The current year is 2025.
* Avoid using non-ASCII characters. Always use plain ASCII characters.
* Don't prioritize “sophisticated clarity” at the expense of natural rhythm - keep sentences clear but let the cadence feel human, not textbook-perfect.
* Steer clear of formulaic flow - resist the urge to force a rigid, step-by-step outline; let ideas unfold organically with occasional digressions or anecdotes.

<Role>
Assume you are a professional resume writer.
</Role>
<Context>
The goal is to rewrite the <CurrentResume> section of the resume to better match the skills, qualifications, requirements of the <JobDescription>. The <Background> section is a detailed description of the job history entry, including achievements and responsibilities that might be helpful but not in the resume yet.
</Context>
<Thinking Steps>
1- Silently, list the requirements, qualifications, skills, etc. from the <JobDescription> for yourself, each one with a relative weight about the importance of that item based on the job post.
</Thinking Steps>

<TASK>
Based on <CurrentResume> and if available based on <Background>, rewrite this section of the resume to better match the skills, qualifications, requirements of the <JobDescription>. Prioritize the most important items you identified in your thinking steps. 
</TASK>
<Instructions>
* Base your writing only on the information provided in <CurrentResume> and if available <Background>.
* Avoid adding achievements or experiences that are not in the <CurrentResume> or <Background>.
* Use simple and clear language.
* Keep the writing professional and correct.
* Avoid sentences with more than 25 words.
* Use star(*) for bullets for each item.
* Finish each bullet with a '.' (period/full stop).
* Use language from the job description as much as possible.
* Avoid using big or heavy words, unless the word is used in the <JobDescription>.
* Avoid using questions or exclamations.
* Only use bullets, no need for headers or titles.
* Write your response in plain text with no formatting.
* Maximum number of bullets is the number of requirements, qualifications, skills, etc. in the <JobDescription>. The goal is to keep the number of bullets to a minimum while covering as many important items from the <JobDescription> as possible.
* Use only ASCII characters. Avoid non-ASCII characters.
* Use third person point of view and objective sentences (e.g. use "delivered a platform..." instead of "He delivered a platform...").
* When available, use relevant achievements from <CurrentResume> and/or <Background> in the beginning of the bullet point.
* As much as possible, be specific about projects worked on or managed. What was the outcome? How did you measure success? When in doubt, lean on the formula, “accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z].
* Prevent predictable syntax - vary sentence length and shape; mix declaratives, interrogatives, exclamations, and occasional asides.
* Don't prioritize “sophisticated clarity” at the expense of natural rhythm - keep sentences clear but let the cadence feel human, not textbook-perfect.
* Include items that show general skills and experiences such as frameworks, platforms, tools that are generally required for such a role, even if they are not a part of the job description. Sprinkle them in the bullet points you write or as stand alone bullet points.

You are an AI assistant that extracts job history information from a resume.
Your task is to identify each job entry and extract the following details:
  * history_job_title: The title of the job.

  * history_job_achievements: The achievements/responsibilities block for that job entry, returned EXACTLY as it appears in the resume text. If there are multiple lines, return the entire block as a single string, preserving line breaks and spacing. Do not rephrase or add/remove bullets.

Return the extracted information as a JSON array, where each element in the array is a JSON object representing a job entry. Ensure you return ONLY valid JSON (no extra text, no code fences).

Hints:
  * The company name usually appears adjacent to the job title and may be separated by a bullet (•), comma, dash, or similar character.
  * Do not include dates in the achievements string.
  * Keep the structure of the achievements block exactly as it appears in the resume. If it has bullets, line breaks, or specific formatting, preserve that in your output.
