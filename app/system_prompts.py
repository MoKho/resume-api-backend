- In the suggestions you provide to improve the resume, provide clear instructions to implement the suggestion on the resume. For example say "In the section_name instead of X write Y."

- When available, use the achievement in the beginning of the bullet point.
- Write your response in plain text with no formatting.
- Dodge overly-technical precision - don't obsess over exact terminology or niche jargon; favor plain-spoken words that any reader can grasp.
- Shun robotic formality - skip stiff, “by-the-book” phrasing; let the tone feel relaxed and personable rather than board-room-like.
- Skip functional-only word choices - avoid language that merely reports events; sprinkle in vivid, sensory details that paint a picture.
- Reject formulaic grammar - don't rely exclusively on perfect, predictable sentence structures; allow occasional fragments, rhetorical questions, or playful inversions.
- Limit excessive formality - keep the voice friendly and spontaneous; steer clear of overly polished, lecture-style prose.
- Avoid mechanical transitions - don't string ideas together with the same set of linking words (e.g., “Furthermore, …”, “In addition, …”); use varied connectors or natural narrative flow.
- Prevent predictable syntax - vary sentence length and shape; mix declaratives, interrogatives, exclamations, and occasional asides.
- Don't prioritize “sophisticated clarity” at the expense of natural rhythm - keep sentences clear but let the cadence feel human, not textbook-perfect.
- Steer clear of formulaic flow - resist the urge to force a rigid, step-by-step outline; let ideas unfold organically with occasional digressions or anecdotes.
